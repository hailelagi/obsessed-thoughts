# Obsessed Thoughts

## Motivation? 

I don't know, I've always wanted to make this, the idea was initially just a twitter bot that scrapes threads for useful information
about programming, resources etc. There's lots of really smart people on twitter, and they're always happy to share what they're thinking!
invaluable information if you ask an aspiring junior dev such as myself. Then I saw a tweet from a stranger validating the need for such a
thing. Will anyone ever use this? I don't know. But, I'm going to make it and I at least might find some use from it.

## Core

A customizable pleasant visual experience, tied to various tooling that finds stuff around the web and lets you hoarde it!

# Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
