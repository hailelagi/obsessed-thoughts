## [STATUS - ABANDONED] 
## 10/14/2020
My twitter developer account was sadly rejected :( apparently the usecase of this side project violates the twitter developer rules, so I couldn't implement the automated rolling of tweet and stopped trying to improve other features. Sad, but such is life.

## Features

- ~User authentication//management~
- twitter bot that scrapes threads ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- ~react notebook interface~

## What did I use?

ExTwitter(bot) + Phoenix(server) + React(client) + Postgres(db)

## Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix do deps.get, deps.compile`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
