# Obsessed Thoughts Web Client

web app note book idea typey thing.

## Motivation? 

I don't know, I've always wanted to make this, the idea was initially just a twitter bot that scrapes threads for useful information
about programming, resources etc. There's lots of really smart people on twitter, and they're always happy to share what they're thinking!
invaluable information if you ask an aspiring junior dev such as myself. Then I saw a tweet from a stranger validating the need for such a
thing. Will anyone ever use this? I don't know. But, I'm going to make it and I at least might find some use from it.

## Features
- User authentication//management
- twitter bot that scrapes threads
- react notebook interface

You should check out (Notion)[https://www.notion.so/pricing] which is releasing v1.0 of their API soon(?)If they do I hope to do interesting things with it. My Client is much inferior to Notion's as you can see :) Ideas for extending the functionality of this play-app are welcome! Please open an issue, however, I'm not promising to work on anything.
